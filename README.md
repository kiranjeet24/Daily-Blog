## Introduction to frappe

Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers ERPNext, is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.
#### Why Frappe?
The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that meta-data is also treated as data. This enables you to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full featured Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

## Introduction to Ldap

- LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. It is an industry standard application protocol (RFC here) that serves to define an interface or   language with which client applications can talk to a directory service (such as OpenLDAP, Active Directory etc.) to query or modify the information in   the directory.
- An LDAP directory (or server) typically stores information about users, user credentials, groups, user memberships and so on. Since they act as a         central repository for user information, they are commonly used for user authentication and authorization.
